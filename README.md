# Wordleish

Worldeish is a [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle)-inspired game written to demonstrate the value that on-chain confidentiality brings to Web3 gaming.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have some TEST tokens. If you don't, go to [the faucet](https://faucet.testnet.oasis.dev/) and get some. Be sure to select "Sapphire" from the dropdown.
2. Go to [wordleish.pages.dev](https://wordleish.pages.dev).

The contract is located at [0x14C82fc6d33ef2AC1122bEB346F2Ce66Bc5ACF5F](https://testnet.explorer.sapphire.oasis.dev/address/0x14C82fc6d33ef2AC1122bEB346F2Ce66Bc5ACF5F). The link will take you to the explorer where you can see transactions and events fly by.

## How it works

1. someone comes along and posts a word
2. some other people come along and try to guess the word

The main differences from Wordle are that the words are not pre-defined, the number of guesses is unlimited, and the contracts don't actually check that the submission is actually a word. All differences can be removed if you so desired, but putting all five letter words on-chain might be a little tedious (not actually so expensive, though; just a couple of dollars at the time of writing). This is just a demo. You get the idea.
