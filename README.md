# Wordleish

Worldeish is a [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle)-inspired game written to demonstrate the value that on-chain confidentiality brings to Web3 gaming.

Here's how it works:

1. someone comes along and posts a word
2. some other people come along and try to guess the word

The main differences from Wordle are that the words are not pre-defined, the number of guesses is unlimited, and the contracts don't actually check that the submission is actually a word. All differences can be removed if you so desired, but putting all five letter words on-chain might be a little tedious (not actually so expensive, though; just a couple of dollars at the time of writing). This is just a demo. You get the idea.
